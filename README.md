# neon image/button

## Description
Created as a visualization for the real neon. Afterwards I changed it into a button to maybe incorporate it into web design for the company. The design is pure css.

## First design
Very colourfull button with visible hover/focus effect and the shadow to add perspectie and place it in space.

## Second design
This was the original idea to create a visualization of a real neon. No borders and a more real (hopefully) effect.

## Third design
No hover effects, rather an image than a button but I added a flickering effect in css to letter 'g'. In css there are setting for slow and fast flickering that can be changed with adding appropriate class to any letter in html.
